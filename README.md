# RideAnalytics

RideAnalytics is a comprehensive data analysis project focused on ride data from various ride-sharing services. This project aims to clean, visualize, and analyze the dataset to extract meaningful insights about ride patterns, tax savings, and cost comparisons.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the original dataset [here](https://xyz.com).

## Project Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, convert date columns, and cap outliers.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize missing values, trip durations, ride frequencies, and cost comparisons.
- **Analysis**: Calculate average trip length, average rides per week/month, tax savings, and cost savings using ride-sharing services.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RideAnalytics.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd RideAnalytics
    ```
3. Install required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the analysis:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open and run the `RideAnalytics.ipynb` notebook.

## Project Overview

### Data Cleaning
- Convert date columns to datetime objects.
- Impute missing end dates using the median trip duration.
- Fill missing categorical values with the most frequent value.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Handle outliers in trip miles.

### Data Visualization
- Heatmap of missing values.
- Distribution of trip durations.
- Number of rides per week and per month.
- Percentage of business vs. personal vs. meal trips.
- Cost comparison between ride-sharing services and regular cabs.

### Analysis
- Average trip length.
- Average rides per week and per month.
- Total tax savings based on business miles.
- Percentage breakdown of trip categories.
- Money saved by using ride-sharing services.

## Results

- Detailed visualizations and insights about ride patterns.
- Significant tax savings from business trips.
- Cost-effective analysis of ride-sharing services vs. traditional cabs.
